# QuickmathsBeef
A port of my C# vector library to Beef. 

## Quickmaths
Using other people's vector libraries is often a pain and usually results in a huge util file to patch up everything they left out or messed up. The purpose of this repo is to be a base for people to copy and edit to fit their needs of a vector library. Since it's written in C# it shouldn't be too hard to port it to other languages as long as they support stack allocated objects and operator overloading. It's licensed under Unlicense so you're free to edit, distribute, change the license or do anything you want with it.
